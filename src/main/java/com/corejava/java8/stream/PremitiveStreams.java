 * Fortunately, to provide a way to work with the three most used primitive types – int, 
 * long and double – the standard library includes three primitive-specialized implementations: 
 * IntStream, LongStream, and DoubleStream. 
 * Primitive streams are limited mainly because of boxing overhead and because creating specialized 
 * streams for other primitives isn’t’ that useful in many cases.
